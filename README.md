The original source code is got from the device manufacturer, and there is no license, document, etc..

But I failed to compile it. It is originally targeted to linux 2.x, I think.
I modified it so that it can be compiled with newer version of gcc and linux.

I don't have any document too, really.
Please, turn to Google if you need any help.
